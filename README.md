monitor internet connectivity for SM Ram

Python script that periodically pings an IP and logs the result to a CSV until you stop it with a KeyboardInterrupt.

### Example Output

**2020-10-22.csv**

```

```

**Format:** timestamp, date string, time string, network status, ping time.

### Configurable Parameters

`DEBUG`: If `True` (default), will print each CSV row to the terminal as well as logging it to the file. If `False`, runs silently.

`TEST_IP`: The host that the script will try to ping. Default is `"8.8.8.8"` (Google's DNS server), but can be changed.

`OUTAGE_DURATION_SEC`: The shortest outage you want to be able to detect (in seconds). The polling rate will be automatically set based on this value. The default is `60`, which detects outages as small as one minute (polls every 30 seconds).
